class Resize(torch.nn.Module):
    """Resize the input image to the given size.
    If the image is torch Tensor, it is expected
    to have [..., H, W] shape, where ... means an arbitrary number of leading dimensions
    .. warning::
        The output image might be different depending on its type: when downsampling, the interpolation of PIL images
        and tensors is slightly different, because PIL applies antialiasing. This may lead to significant differences
        in the performance of a network. Therefore, it is preferable to train and serve a model with the same input
        types. See also below the ``antialias`` parameter, which can help making the output of PIL images and tensors
        closer.
    Args:
        size (sequence or int): Desired output size. If size is a sequence like
            (h, w), output size will be matched to this. If size is an int,
            smaller edge of the image will be matched to this number.
            i.e, if height > width, then image will be rescaled to
            (size * height / width, size).
            .. note::
                In torchscript mode size as single int is not supported, use a sequence of length 1: ``[size, ]``.
        interpolation (InterpolationMode): Desired interpolation enum defined by
            :class:`torchvision.transforms.InterpolationMode`. Default is ``InterpolationMode.BILINEAR``.
            If input is Tensor, only ``InterpolationMode.NEAREST``, ``InterpolationMode.BILINEAR`` and
            ``InterpolationMode.BICUBIC`` are supported.
            For backward compatibility integer values (e.g. ``PIL.Image[.Resampling].NEAREST``) are still accepted,
            but deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15. Please use InterpolationMode enum.
        max_size (int, optional): The maximum allowed for the longer edge of
            the resized image: if the longer edge of the image is greater
            than ``max_size`` after being resized according to ``size``, then
            the image is resized again so that the longer edge is equal to
            ``max_size``. As a result, ``size`` might be overruled, i.e the
            smaller edge may be shorter than ``size``. This is only supported
            if ``size`` is an int (or a sequence of length 1 in torchscript
            mode).
        antialias (bool, optional): antialias flag. If ``img`` is PIL Image, the flag is ignored and anti-alias
            is always used. If ``img`` is Tensor, the flag is False by default and can be set to True for
            ``InterpolationMode.BILINEAR`` and ``InterpolationMode.BICUBIC`` modes.
            This can help making the output for PIL images and tensors closer.
